# YU Path Builder — ITR1 Wiki

Welcome! This wiki explains how to run the project locally, the overall architecture, and the key endpoints/files for ITR1.

## Quick links
- **How to Run**: See `How-to-Run.md`
- **Architecture**: See `Architecture.md` (includes an image sketch)
- **API Endpoints**: See `API-Endpoints.md`
- **Repo Structure**: See `Repo-Structure.md`

## ITR1 notes
- The goal of ITR1 is to show an end‑to‑end slice: GUI + backend logic + tests + documentation.
- Data is currently loaded from resource files (stub data) so the app can run without external services.
